##### - 1 year ago I started taking a course at Cod3r where I learned the whole EcmaScript ecosystem: Javascript, Html, Css, React, Angular, Vue, NodeJs.

##### - In this course, I also learned about databases such as MySql, MongoDb, Postgresql.

##### - I understood a little about the new technology of browsers, the WebWorkers, I found this proposal interesting.

##### - I also learned object-oriented JavaScript, which changed the way I see progamation.

##### - I got to know a little bit about test coverage, and I saw the importance of code quality.

##### - After walking through the EcmaScript system wanted to know more, I felt that something was missing for me to be a good professional.

##### - And I wanted to learn more about Data Structure and Algorithms, and how to implement them in practice.

##### - And on the recommendation of a friend I became interested in the Ruby language and its RubyOnRails framework.

##### - More and more I fall in love with the low level and how things happen "under the hood".

##### - Cod3r - Web Moderno (100h)

##### · I am currently studying the CS'50 Introducing of Computer Science - Havard, I want to understand more about how the basis of everything works.

##### · The plan after this course is to do: Graph Theory And Additive Combinatorics - MIT. I want to delve deeper into graphs :)
